        <h2 className="h2404">History of The Pie</h2>
        <p className="p404">Just steps away from the University of Utah campus, the rich aromas of garlic and fresh baking Pie pizza dough tickle your nose. The swirling scents lead you past colorful murals and old brick walls adorned with graffiti. The candlelit room, filled with college students and professors, feels neither crowded nor uncomfortable as people flow in and out for their daily Pie fix. The University dine-in location is open until 11:00 pm on weekends, and The Pie's full-motion internet camera(s) give the world a glimpse of late-night Pie junkies eating, drinking, and sometimes even studying. This is the epitome of a college hangout, and all Salt Lakers know it simply as THE PIE.</p>
        <h2 className="h2404">You know the legend, now here's the story</h2>
        <p className="p404">The Pie Pizzeria's old brick walls, a valley landmark since 1980, continue to reign atop the "Best Pizza" lists because of the business philosophy that consistency, quality, equitable pricing, and great service are the keys to success. The Pie has been affectionately referred to as "the best-hidden secret in Salt Lake City". This small restaurant, located in the basement underneath the University Pharmacy, is out of sight with only one sign hidden behind a wall on 200 South 1320 East. But with good food and prices, "word of mouth" keeps THE PIE one of the busiest restaurants in the university area. Tourists and locals have found it for over 44 years, but few know its history.

The establishment was remembered by long-time Salt Lake residents as Bimbos, in the Cellar in 1965. Bimbos was a pizza and pasta place where a 14-inch pizza was had for only $2.20. One of only three pizza restaurants at the time, the seats were actually wooden pews and closed on Sunday for use as a church.

In 1980, The Palmer family had the vision to turn the establishment into a great place for college students to relax, enjoy great food, study, and listen to music. An immediate success, students came by the hundreds and The Pie grew from one location to six restaurants spanning Ogden to South Jordan and is still 100% family-owned and locally operated today.</p>
